# nnpkg
nnpkg is the WIP NexNix package manager. It is heavily inspired by GoboLinux, creating a more structured layout for installed programs. However, it also aims to fix some of GoboLinux's problems. It has a more user friendly interface than GoboLinux, being inspired by APT in this respect. 

nnpkg also aims to be more streamlined. Unlike on Debian, where dpkg and APT are seperate, nnpkg keeps everything together.

Finally, it aims to be portable. nnpkg will work on Unix and Windows.
